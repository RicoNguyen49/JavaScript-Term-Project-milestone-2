        <p>How the game works:</p>
           <p> ~The goal of the game is to achive the highest score, traveling through different levels as it gets faster and obsticles change at each milestone.
            The user will control the spaceship with the arrow keys and have to advoid hitting the lazer obsticles as it traverse the universe.</p>

            <p>~The lazers will change colors randomly with most of them being bright and easy to see. the game includes a black out stage where the lazers will turn black making it harder for 
            the user to advoid the obsticle.</p>
            <p>*click on Space Exploration to play!!</p>
